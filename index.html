      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Markus Alexej Persson, better known by his alias <strong>Notch</strong>, was born on June 1, 1979, in Stockholm, Sweden. Despite not finishing high school, his passion and self-taught skills in programming led him to a career in game development with early stints at companies like King.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2009, he founded Mojang Studios – a company that would forever change gaming with the creation of <em>Minecraft</em> – a sandbox game that empowered players to build and explore virtual worlds. His innovative work made Minecraft the best-selling video game in history.

      <h2>Minecraft and Its Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Initially released as a side project in 2009, <em>Minecraft</em> evolved into a global phenomenon known for its unique blocky graphics and limitless creative potential. The game’s open-ended sandbox environment not only captivated millions of players worldwide but also established a thriving community of builders, modders, and content creators.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2014, Microsoft acquired Mojang Studios for $2.5 billion, cementing Minecraft's legacy. Despite Notch’s departure from the company, his vision continues to influence the gaming landscape.

      <h2>Controversial Tweets</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, Notch’s online presence has made him a polarizing figure. His tweets have at times been labeled as offensive by many:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "I'd rather be a fascist [expletive censored] than have a feminine dick, so gladly!"
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        He has also tweeted statements such as "it's okay to be white" and expressed support for conspiracy theories like QAnon. These posts have sparked widespread criticism and have even led Microsoft to remove his name from certain Minecraft elements.
